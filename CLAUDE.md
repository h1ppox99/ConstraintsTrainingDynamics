# CLAUDE.md - Safe & Constrained AI

## Project Overview
This project studies the training dynamics and loss landscapes of differentiable optimization layers (cvxpy, Theseus) compared to soft penalty techniques. The goal is to identify patterns to improve training strategies.

## Technical Stack
- **Package Manager:** `uv`
- **Configuration:** `hydra` (for experiment management)
- **Linting/Formatting:** `ruff`
- **Core Libraries:** `cvxpy`, `theseus`, `torch`, `numpy`

## Specific context files
- **Mathematical context:** see `docs/CONTEXT.md`
- **Metrics context:** see `docs/METRICS.md`
  

## Ambiguity handling
- If any ambiguity is encountered to solve a given taks, refer to the project report at `Midterm_report_WALLAERT.pdf`or ask back the user.
